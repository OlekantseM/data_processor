Overiew

This project automates the process of cleaning, classifying, and splitting user data from Excel spreadsheets. It is designed to handle datasets containing mixed and inconsistent group names.
The script reads user records, groups them based on categories (like Health, Police, Agriculture, Sports, Tourism etc.), and exports each group into its own CSV file. It also detects new/unclassified groups and generates a review file, ensuring the system stays up to date with incoming data.
This eliminates manual sorting, reduces human error, and saves hours of repetitive work.

Tech Stack

Python - Data processing and Excel handling
Regular Expressions (re) - Keyword-based grouping logic
OS Library - File management (creating folders, saving CSVs)
Excel (XLSX) - Input data source
CSV - Output format for grouped data
